# edfconvis
Web app for reading, visualizing and converting EDF and EDF+ files
Specs: http://www.edfplus.info/
The format is used for devices that measure Electroencephalography (EEG) data.
The app is written in Java in combination with the Spring Framework.
On the front end I used D3.js for visualizing the data signals.
